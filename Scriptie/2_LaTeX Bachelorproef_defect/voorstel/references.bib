  abstract  = {This manual is a printed edition of the official Python tutorial from the Python 3.2 distribution. It provides an introduction to Python, an easy to learn object-oriented programming language. This revised edition describes Python 3. Python has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level data types, and dynamic typing. It can link directly to libraries written in C or C++ and can be embedded as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. For each copy of this manual sold USD 1 is donated to the Python Software Foundation by the publisher, Network Theory Ltd.},
